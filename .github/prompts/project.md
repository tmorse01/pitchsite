# ðŸ§  Co-pilot Prompt â€“ PitchSite

Create a React + Vite project called **"PitchSite"** that helps real estate investors generate AI-powered pitch deck websites.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** (TypeScript)
- **Mantine UI** for component styling
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Netlify Functions** for serverless API logic
- **No SSR** â€” purely client-rendered app

---

## âœ… Requirements

### 1. Homepage

- Clean header with title and call-to-action: "Create Your Pitch Deck"
- Button links to `/create`

### 2. Step-by-Step Input Form (`/create`)

Use `@mantine/form` and `Stepper` to guide users through the following fields:

- Project Name
- Address
- Investment Type (e.g., multifamily, flip)
- Purchase Price
- Total Raise
- Target IRR
- Hold Period
- Description (optional)
- Sponsor Bio
- Image upload (simulate with local state only)

### 3. Backend Logic (`/api/generate`)

Create a Netlify Function that:

- Accepts form data via `POST`
- Returns a JSON object with:
  - Executive Summary
  - Investment Thesis
  - Risk Factors
  - Location Overview
  - Sponsor Bio

### 4. Preview Page (`/preview`)

- Render a one-page pitch deck
- Include:
  - Hero section
  - Deal metrics
  - AI-generated sections
  - Sponsor info
  - Contact footer

### 5. Share Page (`/share/:deckId`)

- Simulate short public URL using React Router
- Use local state or static mapping (no DB)
- Display previous pitch content

### 6. File Structure

```
/src
  /api
    client.ts
  /components
  /pages
  App.tsx
  main.tsx
/netlify/functions/generate.ts
netlify.toml
```

### 7. Deployment

- Deploy to **Netlify**
- Use `netlify dev` for local development
- Redirect `/api/generate` to Netlify Function using `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[dev]
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/generate"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/generate"
  status = 200
```

## ðŸ“„ API Response Format (`/api/generate`)

Return the following structure in your Netlify function:

```json

  "executiveSummary": "A concise paragraph explaining the opportunity...",
  "investmentThesis": "A few sentences explaining why this deal makes sense...",
  "riskFactors": ["Interest rates", "Construction delays", "Exit timing"],
  "locationOverview": "A quick overview of the neighborhood or city...",
  "sponsorBio": "A short professional summary about the sponsor..."
}
```
